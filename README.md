### San Fransisco Housing Rental Analysis
_________________________________________
## Project Background
_________________________________________

Proptech**, the application of technology to real-estate markets, is an innovative domain in the fintech industry. Assume that youâ€™re an analyst at a proptech company that wants to offer an instant, one-click service for people to buy properties and then rent them. The company wants to have a trial of this offering in the San Francisco real estate market. If the service proves popular, they can then expand to other markets.

My job is to use your data visualization skills, including aggregation, interactive visualizations, and geospatial analysis, to find properties in the San Francisco market that are viable investment opportunities.

For this homework assignment,I have created and submited the following deliverable:

A Jupyter notebook that contains my analysis of the housing rental market data for San Francisco. The analysis will be complete with professionally styled and formatted interactive visualizations.

## Conclusion of Anlysis

Question: How does the trend in rental income growth compare to the trend in sales prices? Does this same trend hold true for all the neighborhoods across San Francisco?

Answer: # The trend in rental income across the city of San Fransisco is very much consistent and on a rise. where as price per square foor does fluctuate through out the city with some on up trend and some on the down trend as of 2016.

Question: What insights can you share with your company about the potential one-click, buy-and-rent strategy that they're pursuing? Do neighborhoods exist that you would suggest for investment, and why?

Answer: # In terms of real estate investment for an income property I would recommend Siver Terrace, as it is priced at 170 dollar per square foot with a gross monthly rent of 3528 dollars.
